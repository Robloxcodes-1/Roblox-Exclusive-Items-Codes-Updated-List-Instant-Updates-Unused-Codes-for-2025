These codes are often used for promotional purposes, such as celebrating special events, collaborations with other brands, or to reward loyal players. Some of these items are limited-time offers, which means you need to act quickly to redeem them before they expire.

- **Promotions and Events:** Roblox frequently holds events or collaborates with companies to offer special codes for exclusive items.
- **Social Media:** Roblox often shares item codes on their social media accounts, including Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.
- **Partnerships:** Occasionally, Roblox partners with other brands (such as toy companies or movie franchises) to distribute codes for exclusive items.
